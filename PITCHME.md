### DSpace Code

### Running DSpace
You need a runtime environment for your code
- A server with tomcat and a postgres database (linux preferred)
- Docker or Vagrant containers (for developers)
- Cloud development environment like [Codenvy](http://codenvy.com)
  - For simplicity, this is what we will use
  - I will provide instructions to repeat this yourself

- Options for loading content into DSpace
- Configuration customization
